# App Landing Pages

Welcome to the official landing pages for Jacob Kappler’s apps! This project showcases two privacy-first, distraction-free apps—**JournalWrite** and **DreamFrame**—built with care, creativity, and a focus on user experience.

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for the landing pages of:
- **JournalWrite**: A free, offline mood journaling app for iOS.
- **DreamFrame**: A private dream journaling app, also for iOS.

Each landing page is designed to be clean, modern, and informative, with clear navigation, support, and privacy information.
